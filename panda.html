    <h1>Panda</h1>
    <p>
      The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or
      simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by
      its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is
      sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring
      musteloid. Adult individuals average 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb), and
      are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. The species is
      sexually dimorphic, as males are typically 10 to 20% larger. The fur is
      white, with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. A
      thumb is visible on the bear's forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in
      place for feeding. Giant pandas have adapted larger molars and expanded
      temporal fossa to meet their dietary requirements.
